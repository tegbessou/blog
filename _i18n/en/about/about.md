My name is **Hugues Gobet**, and I am a developer passionate about programming. My journey began with the **C** programming language. I then delved into the world of web development, starting with **PHP** and **Symfony**, marking my first steps into the professional sphere. Symfony has always been one of the cornerstones of my expertise. However, over the years, I’ve expanded my skills into software architecture, exploring **Microservices**, **Hexagonal Architecture**, and much more.

I also discovered the importance of good development practices, such as **TDD** (*Test-Driven Development*) and **DDD** (*Domain-Driven Design*), which have transformed the way I think about and design applications. It is precisely to share this journey—rich with discoveries, mistakes, and refinements—that I created this blog. My goal is to make learning DDD easier by sharing my experiences, both successes and failures, and explaining my choices so we can discuss them together.

I apply these practices not only to my personal projects but also to my freelance developer assignments. Among my achievements, I designed an application called **"Dégust' et des couleurs"** (*Tasting and Colors*). It allows users to record restaurant meals and rate the dishes. This project stemmed from a personal need: after many evenings in Michelin-starred restaurants, where I laboriously took notes on my phone, I wanted to simplify this ritual. The application made that possible.

My next project? An app to catalog the wines I taste and the wine tastings I attend. While the idea isn’t groundbreaking, it’s an excellent opportunity to continue applying DDD principles in practice.

I’ll regularly update this blog with my future projects, and I hope you’ll enjoy this exploration of software architecture and good development practices!
